This application is a Note Taker that runs on its own server using Node and Express.js. The user can enter notes and titles, then that input is added to
an API that can be pulled from and referred to at a later time. To use this application, NPM and Express must be installed. 

The deployed application can be found on Heroku under mynotetaker-1.
